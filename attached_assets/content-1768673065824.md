Generic hey or hi 👋

# I'm a Product Designer who thrives in inserting generic jargon (like delight and empathy) and ending sentences at the intersection of art and technology

## Selected Projects

These aren't actually selected, but saying so makes it look like I really had to \*chefs kiss\* _curate_ this. But these are all pretty trojan horses to convince you that I push pixels on the edge of technology and innovation, while creating {adjective} experiences for users while delivering value for the business.

[UX Design\\
**Recognisable Big Tech** \\
I did a really small, tiny thing for them. But I've stuck it behind a password anyway, to make it sound important.\\

[UX Design\\
**\[Verb\] App** \\
This has been shipped, but the developer ruined it. So I’m just going to show you the mockups with dummy text.\\

[Illustration\\
**NewMorphism** \\
I made this up for dribbble likes, because I’m vain like that (read: attention seeking).\\

[UX Design\\
**No context screens** \\
This is a really old project and looking at it gives me absolutely excruciatingly debilitating pain.\\

[Web Design\\
**Some sort of \[Finance\] thing** \\
Another designer did all the actual hard work, so I’ve hidden it at the bottom of my site hoping they’ll never notice\\

## Community

I don’t publish anything on Community because like there is literally nothing to learn from those files. Its a whole mess. I just open Figma and do the ting. “Life is too short to name layers”

I know the general consensus is that carousels are a historically terrible and outdated design pattern. But heres the thing though... Did the past really happen?

## Why are you even looking at this!

You and I both know, this reach out form is just a formality, because if you’re anything like me... you’re gonna compare yourself to other people's portfolios, rethink all your life decisions and then sink into a depressive slump. Congratulations! You now equate your self-worth to your work 🤡
